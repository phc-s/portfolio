PHC-S Portfolio is a front-end application that showcases my projects, experience, and story as a developer. It can get updated throughout the time. It is planned that the current online version will be replaced by a newer version in the near future.

## Content 📚:

The renewed website will include the same aspects of the older project, but giving a priority in casting direct information and providing a clean, minimalist design language. Upgrading most of the whole current project is an important task to be realized, as enhancing  and user experience, as well performance is set to be the focus on this project development.

*more coming soon...*
