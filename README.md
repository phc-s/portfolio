PHC-S Portfolio is a front-end application that showcases my projects, experience, and story as a developer. It can get updated throughout the time. It is planned that the current online version will be replaced by a newer version in the near future.

## Content üìö:

The renewed website will include the same aspects of the older project, but giving a priority in casting direct information and providing a clean, minimalist design language. Upgrading most of the whole current project is an important task to be realized, as enhancing  and user experience, as well performance is set to be the focus on this project development.

It will have these sections:

+ Main - A basic introduction and access to my social media accounts.
+ About - I will insert about me and my experience, including a skills section.
+ Experience - I will insert about my academic experience (professional is going to come).
+ Practical Projects - My real projects made online in World Wide Web domains.
+ Personal Projects - My personal projects that are stored on GitHub (not all of them are public).

## Prototype üñµ:

Here you can see the prototype for all of my projects of design of Github, including this website at "phc-s portfolio" section! I recommend you to see the instructions page before navigating further.
